      <em>Implementation Analyst, Global Delivery (June 2021 - Present)</em>
      <p>At Clearwater Analytics I am part of the Global Delivery team onboarding new clients onto the Clearwater platform.</p>

      </h2>
      <p>At CNOOC International I was embedded into the Plant Optimisation Team undergoing an assess-level (conceptual) study on the installation of multiphase flow meters on the Buzzard North Sea Offshore Asset. On Buzzard there were over 40,000 barrels of oil production losses associated to well testing in 2019. Multiphase flow meters were investigated as a potential alternative well testing method to increase production efficiency and reduce losses.</p>

      <p>I was responsible for project management, process design deliverables (including use of Microsoft Visio to create new, and update existing, PFDs and P&IDs), a safety and operability study, a value case assessment and presenting updates to the team.</p>
      <p> <em>Results</em>
        <ul>
          <li>At the time of writing the study, installing multiphase flow meters had a potential value of up to £7 million.</li>
          <li>Provided CNOOC with an industry (and First Class Standard) quality report that is being held for the decision on installing multiphase flow meters on the Buzzard platform and was used to aid in decisions for the Buzzard Phase II project.</li>
          <li>Self-managed the project when supervisors were unable to provide support ensuring project was completed on time.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p> <em>Problem Solving</em>
        <ul>
          <li>Recommended the most suitable supplier for the multiphase flow meter for CNOOC’s requirements.</li>
          <li>After a Hazard and Operability Study, the potential risks of the installation were identified. These risks were mitigated by suggesting control schemes and sufficient piping classes</li>
        </ul>
